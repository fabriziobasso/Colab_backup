        "\n",
        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this dataset is to facilitate the development and testing of regression models for predicting insurance premiums based on various customer characteristics and policy details. Insurance companies often rely on data-driven approaches to estimate premiums, taking into account factors such as age, income, health status, and claim history. This synthetic dataset simulates real-world scenarios to help practitioners practice feature engineering, data cleaning, and model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This dataset contains 2Lk+ and 20 features with a mix of categorical, numerical, and text data. It includes missing values, incorrect data types, and skewed distributions to mimic the complexities faced in real-world datasets. The target variable for prediction is the \"Premium Amount\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### Features\n",

        "15. Premium Amount: Target variable representing the insurance premium amount (Numerical, skewed)\n",
        "16. Policy Start Date: Start date of the insurance policy (Text, improperly formatted)\n",
        "17. Customer Feedback: Short feedback comments from customers (Text)\n",

        "- Skewed Distributions: Numerical features like **Annual Income** and **Premium Amount** have skewed distributions, which can be addressed through transformations."
